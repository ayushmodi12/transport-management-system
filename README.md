Please run the following command with the cloned repository as the current working directory to install all the required modules and packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create Database & Launch Web Server
Please run the `setup.py` to instantiate the database and launch the web server.  
Make sure that you don't have the database before running `setup.py`. Else directly launch the web server by executing `transport_management_system.py`.
